#### Description:
**The best passwords will thwart brute force and dictionary attacks, but it's also possible to make them easy to remember.**
This command-line program allows users to generate passwords based on word.

The program will prompt the user to input a single word or sentence and base on that input will generate a strong password with a bunch of numbers, special symbols, upper and lower case symbols.

**In this article, you can find information on how to understand password that being created.**

***When User's input is longer than 11 characters these changes make password shorter, and still easy to remember.***
- "for" changed in to "4"
- "one" changed in to "1"
- "two" changet in to "2"

***Apply to short words or sentences under 8 characters.***
- "a" and "A" canged in to "@"
- "e" and "E" canged in to "3"
- "h" and "H" canged in to "#"
- "i" and "I" canged in to "!"
- "l" and "L" canged in to "1"
- "o" and "O" canged in to "0"
- "p" and "P" canged in to "%"
- "s" and "S" canged in to "$"
- All spases is ignored.

How to use it
1. Run the program
2. Input some words or sentenses (be shore that your "word" have more then 8 characters)
3. If inputs is correct you will see your posible new passsword
4. If you like it pres "y" programm will exit
5. If dont, prodram will prompt you for another word to imput.

**The anatomy of a strong password**

Now that we know how passwords are hacked, we can create strong passwords that outsmart each attack (though the way to outsmart a phishing scam is simply not to fall for it). Your password is on its way to being uncrackable if it follows these three basic rules.

**Make it long.**

This is the most critical factor. Choose nothing shorter than 15 characters, more if possible.

**Use a mix of characters.**

The more you mix up letters (upper-case and lower-case), the more potent your password is, and the harder it is for a brute force attack to crack it.

**Don’t use memorable keyboard paths.**

Much like the advice above not to use sequential letters and numbers, do not use sequential keyboard paths either (like qwerty). These are among the first to be guessed.

**Can it be dictionary attacked?**

The key to staving off this type of attack is to ensure the password is not just a single word. Multiple words will confuse this tactic — remember, these attacks reduce the possible number of guesses to the number of words we might use to the exponential power of the number of words we are using.
